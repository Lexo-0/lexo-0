### 👋 Hi there! :)
I'm Lexo Liu, a senior high student, and a developer💻.

I know nothing, but I listen. Feel free to [drop me a message](mailto:me@lexo.cool)!😏

I'm currently working on a cross-platform GUI kit named WaterUI; it hasn't been released yet, but it's coming soon!

# About me

I am but a phantom... Random ideas flash through my mind all the time. I jot them down in a blazing beat, resulting in quite a mess.

My work involves sifting through this mess to find something valuable. It is what I do.
